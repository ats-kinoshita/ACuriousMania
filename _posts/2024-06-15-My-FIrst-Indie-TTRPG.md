This is mostly a test of how these posts will look. As for the content, I will upload some details from my game [Mother-LOD](https://atsumo.itch.io/mother-lod).

# Mother-LOD
A game inspired by the Mothership and Into the Odd Tabletop Roleplaying Games, this is what I made to run Mothership modules and other Industrial Sci-Fi Horror scenarios. The design is a bit out of date compared to what I use currently, but I wanted to keep the 1e rule set available as it is closest in design to its inspirations.

### Game Mechanics

#### Character Stats
Your ability to handle danger is defined by your Harm Protection (HP) and Attribute Stats:
- **HP** reflects your potential to evade fate
- **Body** is your conditioning and constitution
- **Calm** is your composure when pressured
- **Sanity** is your clarity under duress

You can carry a number of items equal to your current Body stat. However, if you carry three or more items of cumbersome Quality, then your HP reduces to 0 from the unwieldy burden.

#### Saving Throws
To resist the consequences of your actions or inactions, make an Attribute Save:
- Determine the most relevant Attribute
- Roll a d20 under or equal to the current value

Rolling 1 always succeeds, while 20 always fails.

#### Making Attacks
When trying to Attack someone, you roll your weapon’s die to see how it goes:
- For Impaired Attacks, you roll a d4 instead
- For Enhanced Attacks, you roll a d12 instead

A weapon with a relevant Quality to affect multiple targets rolls Attacks against all in range.

#### Taking & Dealing Damage
An Attack targeting the Body is reduced by any Armour Points (AP) the target has (3 AP max). The remaining Attack is spent reducing the target’s HP to 0, then their Body:
- Damaging the Body stat means a successful Hit
- If Hit, make a Body Save or take a Critical Hit
- Reducing Body to 0 this way means Death

Special Attacks may likewise target other stats.

#### Critical Hits
Taking a Critical Hit usually means being Incapacitated until you can have a Quick Rest. However, particularly nasty threats may have worse consequences, such as serious Ailments, Injuries, or even Death. If you have a Shield, you can Sacrifice it to negate the Critical.

#### Rest & Recovery
When out of Combat and able to take a few moments for a Quick Rest, characters Recover their HP to full and can get back to their feet if Incapacitated. When able to have a full night’s Long Rest, characters roll Saves for each damaged Attribute, Recovering +1 to those that succeed. Faster options exist, but usually at a cost.

#### Attribute Loss
Some dangers may cause Attribute Loss, bypassing AP and HP entirely, and will have their own effects upon reducing an Attribute to 0.

#### Deprivation
If you are Deprived of basic necessities (sleep, food, water, warmth, or air), then you cannot Recover from any Rest. Certain Ailments and Injuries cause this as well.

#### Combat Rounds
When the order of action is a life or death matter, Combat is initiated. Characters announce what they will do in a round, which is then resolved simultaneously. In a round a character may both:
- Move nearby, including simple interactions
- Take Action, like an Attack or Gambit

Characters Surprised when Combat is initiated must make a Calm Save or miss the first round. Conflicting Outcomes are resolved by the party most at risk making a Save.

#### Gambits
When trying to do a Combat Maneuver (such as called shots, disarming, or tripping), consider if it directly takes the target out:
- If so, then it happens on a Critical Hit
- If not, resolve it like a Conflicting Outcome

Other Gambits outside direct Combat (such as parleys, shadowing, or silent kills) will be adjudicated by the GM case by case; likely by:
- Deal or Dilemma, choose or push for better
- It Happens, live with the consequences
- A Roll, either a Save or plain Luck (d6 roll high)

### Adventuring

#### Stress & Panic
Horrors and failing Saves will build up Stress, a negative Attribute (which reduces on Recovery). When you fail a Save, increase Stress by 1. Whenever you roll 20 on a Save, roll for Panic:
- Make a Stress Save
- On success, consult Panic Table with your roll

##### Panic Table

| #  | Result             | Effect                        |
|----|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1  | Focus              | Roll d12; new HP if higher    |
| 2, 3  | Racing Heart    | +1 Stress                     |
| 4, 5  | Anxiety         | +1 Stress to you & nearby     |
| 6, 7  | Outburst        | +2 Stress to you & nearby     |
| 8, 9  | Overload        | Get Ailment, nearby Panic     |
| 10-12| Despair          | Panic if nearby fail Saves    |
| 13-15| Delirium         | Fail all Sanity Saves         |
| 16-18| Catatonia        | Unresponsive                  |
| 19, 20| Heart Attack    | Dying, d20 min. left          |

#### Expeditions
You are expected to be properly equipped for any Expedition. This comes in the form of Resource Supply, an item that is individually enough for the whole crew’s Usage regarding the resource.
- Carry as much or as little Supply as you want
- Expected Use is done without question
- Creative Use needs a check after for Depletion:
  - 1-3: OK / 4, 5: One Use left / 6: Depleted

Examples: Food, Water, First Aid, Oxygen, Camping, Climbing, Maintenance

#### Commerce and Scarcity
Outside overly dense archologies or colony ships, most live sparsely across planetary systems. As such, sourcing goods is not always so easy. Things with a base price of 100 credits or less can be sought in any settlement, but might be anywhere from 2-10 times base price due to scarcity. Anything more than that can only be bartered for, or sourced at major urban sprawls, and not always legally. Asset Value generally indicates the order of base price in 10’s of credits (i.e., Tools or Weapons start in the 10's, Augments or Drones start in the 100's, Armour or Vehicles start in the 1000’s).

### Running the Game

#### Player-Centric Detailing and Fate
Player Characters (PCs) should be asked for details that they would be familiar with, and what they think their characters would know/do. When they ask if they know something, either they do or they know where they could find out. Have players roll the dice for Non-PCs’ (NPCs) Saves and Attacks involving them.

#### Choosing Rolls/Stats Based on Difficulty
When rolling Luck or trying to determine the Attributes of an NPC, consider the following difficulties when determining values:

| Difficulty Level   | Probability        | 
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Desperate         | 1 in 6 / 17 in 20  | 
| Hard              | 2 in 6 / 13 in 20  | 
| Moderate          | 3 in 6 / 10 in 20  | 
| Easy              | 4 in 6 / 7 in 20   | 
| Trivial           | 5 in 6 / 3 in 20   | 

HP should be measured in how likely a d6 weapon would reduce it to 0; doubled for experienced combatants; and tripled if monstrously resilient.
