My name is Atsushi Kinoshita. I have the following qualities:

- I get hyper-focused while solving problems
- If I'm quiet I'm certainly overthinking
- If my eyes are closed I'm either meditating or sleeping (it's a much closer split than you might think)


### My story

Born in Toronto, I moved across Japan from Tokyo to Aomori, and returned not understanding either place. I like math and thinking things through, to the detriment of practical things if my family is to be believed.
